- Handles different terminal input methods
- Graceful fallback for missing libraries

### Robust Input Handling
- Non-blocking keyboard input
- Support for both WASD and arrow keys
- Proper cleanup of terminal settings

### Clean Architecture
- Modular design with separated concerns
- Easy to extend with new levels or features
- Well-documented code with type hints

## Customization

### Adding New Levels
Edit `game/levels.py` to add new obstacle patterns:

```python
def get_level_obstacles(self, level: int, width: int, height: int):
    # Add your custom level logic here
    if level == 11:
        # Your custom obstacle pattern
        pass
```

### Adjusting Difficulty
Modify speed settings in `game/levels.py`:

```python
self.level_speeds = {
    1: 0.5,  # Slower
    2: 0.4,  # Adjust as needed
    # ...
}
```

### Changing Game Size
Modify the game dimensions in `main.py`:

```python
game_width = 40   # Wider game field
game_height = 20  # Taller game field
```

## Troubleshooting

### Game doesn't respond to keys
- Make sure your terminal supports the required input methods
- Try running with Python 3.7 or higher
- On some systems, you may need to press Enter after each key

### Display issues
- Ensure your terminal supports Unicode characters
- Try adjusting your terminal's font size
- Some terminals may not display colors correctly

### Import errors
- Make sure you're running from the correct directory
- Verify Python path includes the snake_game module
- Try using `python -m snake_game.main` instead

## System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Terminal/Command Prompt with keyboard input support
- No external dependencies required
